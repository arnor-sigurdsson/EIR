EIR
===

EIR is a framework for
supervised modelling,
sequence generation,
survival analysis, and
image/array generation
on genotype, tabular, sequence, image, array, and binary input data.
It is designed to provide
a high-level, yet modular API
that reduces the amount of boilerplate code
and pre-processing required to train a model.

.. warning::
    This project is in alpha phase. Expect backwards incompatible changes and API changes.

TL;DR - Just Show Me How It Works
---------------------------------

Want to see how EIR works first?
Skip ahead to the :ref:`01-genotype-tutorial`
for an example that covers:

* Training a deep learning model on genomic data using just YAML config files
* Command-line training with automatic evaluation metrics and visualizations
* Making predictions on new samples (both known and unknown labels)
* Serving trained models as web APIs for real-time inference
* No boilerplate code - just configuration and results

**Estimated time:** 15-20 minutes

Or browse the :doc:`tutorials/tutorial_index` to see examples for your specific data type.

How to Navigate This Documentation
----------------------------------

The documentation is not designed to be read from start to finish,
so feel free to jump around and explore the sections that interest you.

Generally we do recommend starting with either:

* :ref:`01-genotype-tutorial` for a complete end-to-end example, or
* :ref:`how-eir-works` for an overview of the framework's design and general architecture.

Then, you can for example explore the following sections:

* :ref:`tutorials_index` for various tutorials ranging from
  supervised learning with a single modality,
  to multi-modal generative modelling and serving.
* :ref:`configuration_guides` for kind of a mix between cheat-sheets and more in-depth
  guides focusing on specific configurations
  (e.g., a boilerplate ``globals.yaml`` file) or data types
  (e.g., how to configure EIR for genomic data).
* :ref:`api-reference` for a complete reference of all configuration options.
* :ref:`user-guides-index` for various user guides, tips and tricks.

Installation
------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Python 3.13 (must be installed and accessible in your PATH for ``venv`` or specifiable for ``conda``/``uv``)

Installation Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1. Create a Python 3.13 environment:**

*Using venv* (ensure ``python3.13`` or the correct alias for your Python 3.13 installation is used):

.. code-block:: console

    $ python3.13 -m venv eir-env  # Or use 'python -m venv eir-env' if 'python' is already Python 3.13
    $ source eir-env/bin/activate

*Using conda:*

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda create -n eir-env python=3.13
    $ conda activate eir-env

*Using uv:*

.. code-block:: console

    $ uv venv eir-env --python 3.13
    $ source eir-env/bin/activate

**2. Verify Python 3.13 in your environment:**

Once your chosen environment is activated, verify the Python version:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python --version
    # Should show Python 3.13.x

**3. Install EIR:**

With your Python 3.13 environment activated:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install eir-dl

**4. Verify installation:**

.. code-block:: console

    $ eirtrain --help

.. important::
    The latest version of EIR supports `Python 3.13 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.
    Using an older version of Python will install an outdated version of EIR,
    which is likely to be incompatible with the current documentation
    and may contain bugs. Please make sure that you are installing EIR in a Python 3.13 environment.

Installing EIR via Container Engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's an example with Docker:

.. code-block:: console

    $ docker build -t eir:latest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnor-sigurdsson/EIR/master/Dockerfile
    $ docker run -d --name eir_container eir:latest
    $ docker exec -it eir_container bash

GPU Support
~~~~~~~~~~~

EIR automatically detects and uses GPU acceleration when available.
No additional configuration is required if you have a CUDA-compatible setup
with PyTorch GPU support. It should also work with MPS on macOS.
