## Install

### Installing EIR via `pip`

`pip install eir-dl`

**Important:** The latest version of EIR requires [Python 3.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Using an older version of Python will install an outdated version of EIR, which will likely be incompatible with the current documentation and might contain bugs. Please ensure you are using Python 3.13.

### Installing EIR via Container Engine

Here's an example with Docker:

```
docker build -t eir:latest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnor-sigurdsson/EIR/master/Dockerfile
docker run -d --name eir_container eir:latest
docker exec -it eir_container bash
```

## Usage

Please refer to the [Documentation](https://eir.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) for examples and information.

## Use Cases

EIR allows for training and evaluating various deep-learning models directly from the command line. This can be useful for:

- Quick prototyping and iteration when doing supervised modelling or sequence generation on new datasets.
- Establishing baselines to compare against other methods.
- Fitting on data sources such as large-scale genomics, where DL implementations are not commonly available.

If you are an ML/DL researcher developing new models, etc., it might not fit your use case. However, it might provide a quick baseline for comparison to the cool stuff you are developing, and there is some degree of [customization](https://eir.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/tutorial_index.html#customizing-eir) possible.

## Features

- **General**
  - Train models directly from the command line through `.yaml` configuration files.
  - Training on [genotype](https://eir.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/a_using_eir/01_basic_tutorial.html), [tabular](https://eir.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/a_using_eir/02_tabular_tutorial.html), [sequence](https://eir.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/a_using_eir/03_sequence_tutorial.html), [image](https://eir.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/a_using_eir/05_image_tutorial.html), [array](https://eir.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/a_using_eir/08_array_tutorial.html) and [binary](https://eir.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/a_using_eir/06_raw_bytes_tutorial.html) input data, with various modality-specific settings available.
  - Seamless multi-modal (e.g., combining [text + image + tabular data](https://eir.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/a_using_eir/07_multimodal_tutorial.html), or any combination of the modalities above) training.
  - Train multiple features extractors on the same data source, e.g., [combining vanilla transformer, Longformer and a pre-trained BERT variant](https://eir.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/a_using_eir/04_pretrained_sequence_tutorial.html) for text classification.
  - Support for [checkpointing and continued training](https://eir.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/e_pretraining/01_checkpointing.html), as well as [pretraining and transferring parts of trained models to new tasks](https://eir.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/e_pretraining/02_mini_foundation.html).
- **Supervised Learning**
  - Supports continuous (i.e., regression) and categorical (i.e., classification) targets.
  - [Multi-task / multi-label](https://eir.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/a_using_eir/07_multimodal_tutorial.html#appendix-b-multi-modal-multi-task-learning) prediction supported out-of-the-box.
  - Model explainability for genotype, tabular, sequence, image and array data built in.
  - Computes and graphs various evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, PCC and R2 for regression tasks, accuracy, ROC-AUC, etc. for classification tasks) during training.
- **Sequence Generation**
  - Supports various sequence generation tasks, including basic sequence generation, sequence to sequence transformations, and image to sequence transformations. For more information, refer to the respective tutorials: [sequence generation](https://eir.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/c_sequence_output/01_sequence_generation.html), [sequence to sequence](https://eir.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/c_sequence_output/02_sequence_to_sequence.html), [image to sequence](https://eir.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/c_sequence_output/03_image_to_sequence.html) and [tabular to sequence](https://eir.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/c_sequence_output/04_tabular_to_sequence.html).
- **Image Generation**
  - Image generation is supported. For more information, refer to the respective tutorials: [Building a Simple Image Autoencoder](https://eir.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/f_image_output/01_foundational_autoencoder.html), [Image Colorization and Super-Resolution](https://eir.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/f_image_output/02_image_coloring_and_upscaling.html) and [Guided Diffusion for Image Generation](https://eir.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/f_image_output/03_mnist_diffusion.html).
- **Array Output**
  - Supports array output tasks, such as building simple autoencoders for tasks like [MNIST Digit Generation](https://eir.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/d_array_output/01_autoencoder.html).
- **Time Series**
  - Time series inputs and outputs is possible, such as [Transformer-based Power Consumption Prediction](https://eir.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/g_time_series/01_time_series_power.html) and [Stock Price Prediction Using Transformers, One-shot and Diffusion Models](https://eir.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/g_time_series/02_time_series_stocks.html).
- **Survival Analysis**
  - Time-to-event prediction is supported as an output type, demonstrated through [Patient Survival Prediction using Free Light Chain Data](https://eir.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/h_survival_analysis/01_survival_flchain.html) and [Survival Analysis Using Cox Proportional Hazards Model](https://eir.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/h_survival_analysis/02_survival_flchain_cox.html).

- [Many more settings](https://eir.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api_reference.html) and configurations (e.g., augmentation, regularization, optimizers) available.
